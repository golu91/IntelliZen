# Problem Statement

## CLASSROOM ENERGY CONSERVATION

In modern society, energy conservation has become an increasingly critical concern due to its implications for sustainability, environmental preservation, and cost reduction. Despite the growing awareness of the need to conserve energy, classrooms often remain significant contributors to energy wastage. This issue arises from various factors, including inefficient use of lighting, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, as well as the overuse of electronic devices and appliances.

## Goal of this project

The primary goal of this project is to significantly reduce energy consumption and promote sustainability in classrooms through comprehensive energy conservation initiatives.

• Energy Reduction: Implement measures to systematically reduce energy consumption in classrooms, targeting areas such as lighting, heating, ventilation, and electronic device usage.

• Cost Savings: Achieve cost savings by optimizing energy usage, thereby reducing utility expenses associated with electricity, heating, and cooling.

• Environmental Impact: Minimize the environmental footprint of classrooms by lowering greenhouse gas emissions and resource depletion associated with energy production.

• Education and Awareness: Increase awareness and understanding among students, faculty, and staff about the importance of energy conservation and sustainable practices in classrooms and beyond.

• Behavioral Change: Foster a culture of energy efficiency and sustainability by encouraging behavioral changes, such as turning off lights and electronic devices when not in use, and utilizing natural light and ventilation whenever possible.

• Technology Integration: Integrate energy-efficient technologies and infrastructure upgrades to enhance the energy performance of classrooms, including the installation of energy-efficient lighting, HVAC systems, and smart controls.

• Monitoring and Evaluation: Establish mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of energy conservation measures, allowing for continuous improvement and refinement of strategies over time.

By achieving these goals, the project aims to transform classrooms into energy-efficient, sustainable learning environments that serve as models for responsible energy management and environmental stewardship within educational institutions and broader communities.



# Intel DevCloud

Intel DevCloud is a one-stop, cloud-based DevSecOps platform that provides a bundle of out-of-the-box cloud services covering requirement delivery, code commit, code check, code build, verification, deployment, and release. DevCloud streamlines software delivery, provides E2E software R&D support. It also provides access to powerful CPUs and GPUs, which allow for faster processing of data and computations compared to Google Colab. This can be especially beneficial for data scientists and developers who work with large datasets and complex algorithms.

# Intel OneAPI Base Kit

The Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit (Base Kit) is a core set of tools and libraries for developing high-performance, data-centric applications across diverse architectures. It features an industry- leading C++ compiler that implements SYCL", an evolution of C++ for heterogeneous computing.

Domain-specific libraries and the Intel® Distribution for Python provide drop-in acceleration across relevant architectures. Enhanced profiling, design assistance, and debug tools complete the kit.

# Intel Al Chatbot / Hugging face

Intel and Hugging Face" are building powerful Al optimization tools to accelerate transformers for training and inference. The companies are collaborating to build state-of-the-art hardware and software acceleration to train, fine-tune, and predict with Hugging Face Transformers and the Optimum extension.

# Intel SYCL / DPC++ Complier

SYCL is an open alternative to single-architecture proprietary languages. It allows developers to reuse code across hardware targets (CPUs and accelerators such as GPUs and FPGAs) and also perform custom tuning for a specific accelerator. These code walkthroughs introduce you to basic principles and practices of SYCL programming. SYCL is an alternative to single- vendor proprietary accelerator programming languages Allows code reuse across hardware targets (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and supports custom tuning for a specific platform SYCL is a Khronos standard that adds data parallelism and heterogeneous programming to familiar and standard ISO C++ oneAPI is an open source LLVM technology implementation with SYCL at its center. API extensions are driven by open and cooperative community development. Once proven, these enhancements are proposed to the parent specifications (C++ or SYCL) for implementation.

# How to start ?
You start our project by running the [Start Here](https://github.com/DarkTechPirate/IntelliZen/blob/main/Web-Interface/start.html) file.
Here is the way how you can continue after that.

Abouve image is our dashboard in the main websire where you will be able to adjust all the electrical instruments. Here you can also find the data and analysis of your power usage.
And you can also get the statistical report of power useage , and you can also get AI based ideas or methods to reduce the power by adding different combinations.
